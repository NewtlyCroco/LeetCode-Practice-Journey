# LeetCode-Practice-Journey
All of my trial and error practicing and learning to master leetcode. Every Monday and Wednesday I have Coding sessions scheduled!


# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Journey

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Journey**! 🎯 This is where I document all my **trials, errors, successes, and struggles** while working through LeetCode problems. The goal? To level up my coding skills one problem at a time! 💪  

I have scheduled **Coding Sessions** every **Monday and Wednesday** ⏳, so expect consistent updates!  


## 🏆 Goals & Challenges  

### Short-Term Goals 🎯  
- Solve at least 2 problems per week.  
- Improve efficiency using optimal solutions.  
- Get super comfortable with all my core data structures and techniques again (DP, BFS, DFS, Window slide, Binary Search etc.) :)

### Long-Term Goals 🚀  
- Reach **100+ problems solved!** 🎉  
- Get better at **time complexity analysis** ⏳.  
- Ace **technical interviews with confidence!** 🏅 
- Improve **Coding Confidence** 
- Host my own club teaching others to master data structures
